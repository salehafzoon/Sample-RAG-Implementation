Some patients often do not pay enough attention to it and do not go to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment in time, causing great harm to themselves. So, what are gastrointestinal disorders? What are the symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders? A doctor from Chongqing Dongda Anorectal Hospital said that gastrointestinal dysfunction, also known as gastrointestinal neurosis, is a functional disease. It is generally believed that mental factors are the main causes of this disease, such as emotional stress, anxiety, difficulties in life and work, worries, accidents, etc., which can lead to abnormal gastrointestinal function and further cause gastrointestinal dysfunction. Most gastrointestinal disorders have a slow onset, often last for years, and may be persistent or recurring. People suffering from gastrointestinal disorders often present with acid reflux, belching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, burning sensation under the chest, bloating after eating, and obvious upper abdominal discomfort or pain. Such symptoms will be significantly aggravated when mood changes. Why you suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunction: (1) Diet. Excessive diet, irritating food, unclean diet, indigestible food, allergic food, hard food and unsuitable food may induce or aggravate gastrointestinal dysfunction. Food is a common cause of gastrointestinal dysfunction. (2) Catching cold can easily induce and aggravate gastrointestinal spasms. Especially emaciated people are prone to catching cold. Some people are particularly sensitive to cold. Turning on a little air conditioning in summer, staying in a north-facing room or sitting on a cold bench in winter will all cause problems. Abdominal pain, borborygmi, and diarrhea occur. (3) Work. Excessive fatigue, heavy tasks, overloaded movements; long-term work pressure, fatigue, overtime, etc., insufficient rest time and irregular life, irregular meals, skipping breakfast in the morning, staying up late, etc., over time, gastrointestinal function will occur disorder. Harm of gastrointestinal dysfunction: Symptoms such as gastric bloating, burping, acidity, and heartburn may occur; frequent diarrhea can reduce the body’s resistance and weaken the body’s resistance to infectious diseases and various infections; repeated diarrhea can stimulate Intestinal mucosa can cause intestinal mucosal lesions, such as transforming into ulcerative colitis or even malignant transformation; it seriously affects the patient's quality of life and has a certain impact on the patient's life and work. Some patients even dare not do so due to frequent abdominal pain and diarrhea. Or unable to go to work normally; gastrointestinal dysfunction can cause malabsorption of nutrients, anemia and vitamin deficiency.\n",

      "Text: Reflux is the backflow of stomach acid and digestive juices from the stomach into the esophagus. This condition may cause damage to the esophageal mucosa, causing pain and discomfort. Common reflux symptoms include a burning sensation in the chest, a sour or bitter taste in the back of the mouth, cough, and sore throat. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic acid reflux disease that may cause inflammation and damage to the esophagus. The causes of GERD include gastroptosis, esophageal sphincter relaxation, and abnormal esophageal peristalsis function. Here are some common ways to diagnose and treat gastroesophageal reflux disease: Diagnosis: History and Symptom Assessment: Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history, such as a burning sensation in your chest, a sour taste after the flu, etc. Physical exam: Your doctor may perform a physical exam to rule out other possible illnesses. Examination: such as gastroscopy, esophageal acidity measurement, X-ray examination, etc. to evaluate the condition of the esophagus and stomach.\n",

       "\"Here is some additional professional health knowledge that can help you better analyze the report:\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n3. Gastrointestinal disorders: It is a type of gastrointestinal disease. Some patients often do not pay enough attention to it and do not go to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment in time, causing great harm to themselves. So, what are gastrointestinal disorders? What are the symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders? A doctor from Chongqing Dongda Anorectal Hospital said that gastrointestinal dysfunction, also known as gastrointestinal neurosis, is a functional disease. It is generally believed that mental factors are the main causes of this disease, such as emotional stress, anxiety, difficulties in life and work, worries, accidents, etc., which can lead to abnormal gastrointestinal function and further cause gastrointestinal dysfunction. Most gastrointestinal disorders have a slow onset, often last for years, and may be persistent or recurring. People suffering from gastrointestinal disorders often present with acid reflux, belching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, burning sensation under the chest, bloating after eating, and obvious upper abdominal discomfort or pain. Such symptoms will be significantly aggravated when mood changes. Why you suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunction: (1) Diet. Excessive diet, irritating food, unclean diet, indigestible food, allergic food, hard food and unsuitable food may induce or aggravate gastrointestinal dysfunction. Food is a common cause of gastrointestinal dysfunction. (2) Catching cold can easily induce and aggravate gastrointestinal spasms. Especially emaciated people are prone to catching cold. Some people are particularly sensitive to cold. Turning on a little air conditioning in summer, staying in a north-facing room or sitting on a cold bench in winter will all cause problems. Abdominal pain, borborygmi, and diarrhea occur. (3) Work. Excessive fatigue, heavy tasks, overloaded movements; long-term work pressure, fatigue, overtime, etc., insufficient rest time and irregular life, irregular meals, skipping breakfast in the morning, staying up late, etc., over time, gastrointestinal function will occur disorder. Harm of gastrointestinal dysfunction: Symptoms such as gastric bloating, burping, acidity, and heartburn may occur; frequent diarrhea can reduce the body’s resistance and weaken the body’s resistance to infectious diseases and various infections; repeated diarrhea can stimulate Intestinal mucosa can cause intestinal mucosal lesions, such as transforming into ulcerative colitis or even malignant transformation; it seriously affects the patient's quality of life and has a certain impact on the patient's life and work. Some patients even dare not do so due to frequent abdominal pain and diarrhea. Or unable to go to work normally; gastrointestinal dysfunction can cause malabsorption of nutrients, anemia and vitamin deficiency.\\n21. Indigestion: It refers to abnormal function of the digestive system or discomfort during digestion. Common indigestion symptoms include bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fullness, heartburn, etc. There are many causes of indigestion, which may be related to eating habits, lifestyle, digestive system diseases, etc. Here are some common causes of indigestion: Eating habits: Overeating, eating too fast, overeating, and insufficient intake of high-fat, high-fiber foods can all lead to indigestion. Lifestyle: Remaining sedentary for long periods of time, lack of exercise, lack of sleep, excessive tension and stress can have a negative impact on the digestive system. Digestive disorders: Digestive disorders such as gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cholecystitis, gallstones, and pancreatitis may cause indigestion symptoms. Drugs and Chemicals: Certain drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and other substances may irritate or negatively affect the digestive system.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThis is a patient’s medical record.
