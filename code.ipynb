Some patients often do not pay enough attention to it and do not go to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment in time, causing great harm to themselves. So, what are gastrointestinal disorders? What are the symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders? A doctor from Chongqing Dongda Anorectal Hospital said that gastrointestinal dysfunction, also known as gastrointestinal neurosis, is a functional disease. It is generally believed that mental factors are the main causes of this disease, such as emotional stress, anxiety, difficulties in life and work, worries, accidents, etc., which can lead to abnormal gastrointestinal function and further cause gastrointestinal dysfunction. Most gastrointestinal disorders have a slow onset, often last for years, and may be persistent or recurring. People suffering from gastrointestinal disorders often present with acid reflux, belching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, burning sensation under the chest, bloating after eating, and obvious upper abdominal discomfort or pain. Such symptoms will be significantly aggravated when mood changes. Why you suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunction: (1) Diet. Excessive diet, irritating food, unclean diet, indigestible food, allergic food, hard food and unsuitable food may induce or aggravate gastrointestinal dysfunction. Food is a common cause of gastrointestinal dysfunction. (2) Catching cold can easily induce and aggravate gastrointestinal spasms. Especially emaciated people are prone to catching cold. Some people are particularly sensitive to cold. Turning on a little air conditioning in summer, staying in a north-facing room or sitting on a cold bench in winter will all cause problems. Abdominal pain, borborygmi, and diarrhea occur. (3) Work. Excessive fatigue, heavy tasks, overloaded movements; long-term work pressure, fatigue, overtime, etc., insufficient rest time and irregular life, irregular meals, skipping breakfast in the morning, staying up late, etc., over time, gastrointestinal function will occur disorder. Harm of gastrointestinal dysfunction: Symptoms such as gastric bloating, burping, acidity, and heartburn may occur; frequent diarrhea can reduce the body’s resistance and weaken the body’s resistance to infectious diseases and various infections; repeated diarrhea can stimulate Intestinal mucosa can cause intestinal mucosal lesions, such as transforming into ulcerative colitis or even malignant transformation; it seriously affects the patient's quality of life and has a certain impact on the patient's life and work. Some patients even dare not do so due to frequent abdominal pain and diarrhea. Or unable to go to work normally; gastrointestinal dysfunction can cause malabsorption of nutrients, anemia and vitamin deficiency.\n",
