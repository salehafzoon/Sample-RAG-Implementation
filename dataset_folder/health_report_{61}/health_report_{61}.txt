From yesterday to today, my stomach has been painful, and I pulled 7.8 stools for 7.8 times. I measured my body temperature by 37.3 degrees last night. What kind of medicine should I take?
Hello, do you can't eat something clean?
Is there any greasy food, spicy and irritating food, drinking and smoking, high mental stress, poor sleep, etc. Have you ever done any other examinations, what medicines have you taken?
Considering the possibility of acute gastroenteritis.
You can eat Mongolian stone scattered, levofloxacin capsules.
I ate some greasy food a few days ago, and I did not have any inspections and did not take any medicine in the near future.
OK.OK.Both pharmaceutical shops are available.
It is recommended to check a stool routine.
OK, thanks.
Health is to rely on your own maintenance, not by doctors, medicines, drugs, sunlight, smile, that is health, don't put too much pressure on yourself, come on.
Hello doctor, after taking the medicine, my lover is still diluted. After eating, I have a stomachache and stomach. I still have to take medicine.
Is there a stool inspection?Did you draw blood?It is recommended that you go to the emergency department.
Observe whether there are electrolyte disorders and increased blood.
It needs further treatment.It's not easy to say.
OK
