A while ago, I always reflected in the stomach, and the gastroesophageal reflux.Recently, the back of the ribs feel radioactive, is it related to stomach disease (male, 29 years old)
Hello, according to your situation, I suggest you check the gallbladder.
To be a hepatobiliary color Doppler ultrasound, it is the stomach to exclude the cholecystectomy problem.
Will the back of the gallbladder hurt?
Yes, I will.
It is usually feeling that the ribs do not hurt, that is, when you inhale hard and expand the ribs, the ribs on the back will have that soreness.
There seemed to be before, but I didn't care.There is also the annual meeting of the company a while ago, and I drank a lot of wine.
If it is a cholecimal problem, what kind of medicine is taken, what kind of medicine is taken to the liver, and what kind of medicine is taken for stomach problems.
Consider the problem of gallbladder. At that time, you need to check and eliminate it. You sent the inspection and saw it. Then I prescribed the medicine for you.
I do nâ€™t know how to say what medicine to take, gallbladder, stomach and liver disease, there are many diseases, there is no way to prescribe medicine.
Also, I feel that I feel a little bit sore on the left side of my neck these days. I feel comfortable with my hand twice. It is also a bit uncomfortable near the throat knot. Is it caused by the reflux of the gastric pipe?
Consider cervical spondylosis.Is there any anti -heartburn?Now.
It is not muscle soreness, it feels near lymph.
Sometimes at night.
Well, it is likely to be caused by reflux esophagitis.
You can eat omeprazole and dopanratone.
How long will you eat.
For three days, check it out if no effect.
OK
