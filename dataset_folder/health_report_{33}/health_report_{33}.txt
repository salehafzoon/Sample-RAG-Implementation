The stool is a banana shape, it is difficult to defecate, and it is difficult to fart (female, 42 years old)
Hello, how long has this happened?Have you noticed your diet recently.Spicy stimulating greasy food.
For two years, I can't remember.
I used to love spicy and greasy foods, but I haven't eaten recently.
Do the anus contraction exercise, and you can put out fart again.
Whether or not bloating.
Stool -shaped from the age of 20.
There is no obvious bloating.
Gastrointestinal dysfunction is accompanied by insufficient motivation.
Take oral drug conditioning.
In the past, there would be a bit of meat from the stool. It was normal for a while, and the stool could be tightened again.
Hmm, insufficient power.
I used to suspect that there was something in the intestinal and anus.
Orally, Malaysian sour curve ometine + lactate sugar adjustment is 1-2 weeks.Have you ever done an colonoscopy.
