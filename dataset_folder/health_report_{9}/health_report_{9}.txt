The abdominal pain around the navel is more than a month of abdomen. I am now residual in the glandular samples. I â€™m nauseous to brush my teeth every day.I suspect that the stools are stacked around the navel due to the decline of gastrointestinal function, which can not be discharged. Every time there is anal swelling, but it cannot be discharged, so I want to ask how to treat it.Essence
You can go to our hospital.
What do you do if you mean? Go to your hospital, which hospital is not the same.
Make a gastrointestinal meal, and then prescribe medicine for treatment.
Is it for gastrointestinal meal or a full gastrointestinal meal?
Full digestive tract meal.
Okay, thank you.
You can just send snacks.
