I did a colonoscopy two months ago. Now I feel a bit uncomfortable with the intestine.
Hello, I am glad to answer your questions!
How about stool?What is uncomfortable?
It is normal to stool, but occasionally feel a little painful.
Bloating.
Generally, it will be a bit swollen when you do a colonoscopy, but it will not be because of colonoscopy for so long.
Then there is no need to do a colonoscopy again, right?
If the pain is not long, you can observe it again.No need to do it.
Forehead.
But I have multiple gastric ulcers.
Pay attention to keep warm, don't be cold, and it is more likely to cause intestinal discomfort.
Gastric ulcers generally do not cause lower abdomen pain.
At present, I have taken gastric ulcers for two months, and I still have mild pain and bloating.
Um.
Is it not cured or what?
This can go to the previous hospital to find a doctor for a review.See if you need to adjust the medicine.
You see that my gastric ulcer is severe.
The largest is 0.6x0.5
Moderate.
I am afraid of worsening.
Treatment.Don't worry too much.
Forehead.
Go to the gastroscopy after half a year to one year.
Do you have to review each year?
It is best to be extended to 3 years in the first year, or when the symptoms are worse.
Uh, know.
Uh-huh.
