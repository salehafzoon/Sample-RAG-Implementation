Hello?What are you uncomfortable?
Hyinobacteria is positive.
There are usually no symptoms.
Do you think there is a problem with the indicators I posted?Do you have to take medicine?
After the examination, do you find the doctor? Is it recommended to take medicine for treatment?
Without going to the hospital, I would like to understand these indicators first and see if it is necessary to go to the hospital.
