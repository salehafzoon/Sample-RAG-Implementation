I always feel that I want to defecate, but I ca nâ€™t discharge, and I feel uncomfortable.
Hello, how about the stool recently?How long have you been like this?How about eating on weekdays?
It has been two days, bowel movements, but not smooth, there will always be this feeling. I have eaten Muxiang Shunqi Pills and Shu liver Jianwei Pills. I ate twice yesterday.
Diet is fast food, very troublesome.
Do you usually eat overeating, or eat too fast, too full?
This is the third day, but the first night is much better, and the next day I sit on work for too long and uncomfortable.
Is there abdominal pain?
Basically there is no habit of eating breakfast.
It's not too fast.
Without abdominal pain, you want to defecate and not discharge.
I went to the toilet in the morning.
According to your description, the consideration may be that the digestion may not be very good. It is recommended that you usually eat, eat more vegetables, fruits, and pay attention to the right amount of exercise, otherwise the gastrointestinal movement will also be affected, which will affect the defecation. In addition, if the bloating is uncomfortableYou can eat a migrate to help promote gastrointestinal exercise.
I can't help but sit for ten hours every day.
My stomach is not bloated, but my stomach.
Go back at night and have time to exercise in moderation.
Okay, thank you doctor.
You're welcome^_^
