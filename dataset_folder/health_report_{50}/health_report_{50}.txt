The stomach is always gurgling, and sometimes abdominal pain, and a bit of indigestion. What is going on with the doctor?(Male, 24 years old)
How long is this?How about stool?
Stool is okay, it didn't take long for a long time.
Is there any sour snoring?
There is no acid, a bit of snoring.
Oh, it should be indigestion, the stool is basically normal, and the problem is not big.
If you are really not assured, you can do the gastroscopy, except the digestive ulcer.
What kind of medicine can I take? What should I pay attention to?
You can take some medicines that promote gastrointestinal power, such as Moshabeli tablets, or mumopoline, add todboprazole tablets, usually eat light diet, do not drink coffee, strong tea, smoking alcohol, more vegetables and fruits.
OK, thanks.
No thanks.
