Do not pain or pain.
I can't say how it hurts.
Is there any urgency and urinary pain frequency?
No.
Is it burning?
no.
How long?
Just like this recently, it will hurt for a while after the toilet, and then it's okay.
It is best to make a urinary B -ultrasound to see if there are stones, you are in this case.
stone?
so serious?
Not necessarily, but it cannot be ruled out.
OK, thanks.
