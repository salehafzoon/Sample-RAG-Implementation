What is the problem with shit and stinky and sticky. (Female, 26 years old)
How long has this happened?Is there any cause.
It's not clear.
It's ten days.
Is there any uncomfortable besides these?
No uncomfortable.
It is particularly smelly stool.
Does the stomach hurt?Is it swelling?
Rush down and stick to the toilet.
I had a little stomach pain before.
It seems to be gynecological.
But now I don't feel uncomfortable.
It does not rise.
Gynecology has nothing to do with stool.Does the color of the stool change?
No change.
How many times a day?
Once every two days.
Does the number of defecations change before?
No.
That should be not big.What are you eating spicy and irritating or greasy food recently?
Eat old hens.
There are beef.
This is not surprising.
This situation is relatively light.
Why eat such greasy food?
It's getting angry.
Well, it is recommended to eat a light diet.
Old hen stew soup.
I'm feeding.
So eat compare.
Oh, no wonder.All right.
Is it okay to eat rib soup?
Since this is the case, don't take medicine first, adjust it from the diet first.
In fact, normal diet can be milk.
I can only tell you that from the perspective of gastrointestinal doctors, it is recommended to eat a light diet.
OK
Thank you doctor.
Unkind.
