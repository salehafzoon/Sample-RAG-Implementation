I did gastroscopy two years ago, superficial gastritis, and Helicobacter pylori exceeded the standard. Now the stomach is uncomfortable, the stomach is blocked, and the throat is uncomfortable. Doctors recommend making gastroscopy again. Is it necessary to do it?(Female, 40 years old)
How long has this happened?
Hello, I am Dr. Yan Yan in the Department of Gastroenterology. This consultation will let me answer it for you!
Did you review it after treatment?
One month.
No.
Take a lot of medicine.
Then you have to review this time to find out what the specific state is.
I feel blocked now, I do n’t know if it ’s a swallow, or the esophagus, and sometimes I ca n’t hit it.
Can I do a painless gastroscopy?
This is necessary to make a gastroscopy.
How old?Are there any other diseases?
There is estimation of pharyngitis, I am 40 years old, and my throat has a sputum that I ca n’t cough.
Therefore, the gastroscopy was not completed that day, and it was too nervous.
Then do a painless one.
Want to make painless or meals.
Um.

Okay, thank you, you can see it clearly.
OK.Are there any questions?
Thank you, do it tomorrow.
Gone.
Hmm, I wish you a speedy recovery.
