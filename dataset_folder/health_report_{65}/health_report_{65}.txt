Is there any big problem?Baidu said on Baidu.Can't eat enteritis after drinking.
Well, it is best not to drink during taking it. Now when you drink it, you can observe it first. If you do n’t have any uncomfortable, you do n’t have to consider going to the hospital.
How long can you rest assured that you can rest assured.
Generally 8 temporarily, it is okay if there is no problem.
