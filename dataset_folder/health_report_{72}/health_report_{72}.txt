I have a cold. I have taken medicine to the hospital. I suddenly feel dizzy, nausea, a little panic, uncomfortable, hot, but not going out. What is going on?There is no stomach eloquence in anything, all disgusting (female, 23 years old)
Hello, there is fever, there is nothing diarrhea.
Drinking plenty of water and rest may be caused by a cold.What kind of medicine is taken now?
There is no diarrhea, and there should be no thermometer. There is no thermometer.
Now take white plus black and cough syrup, as well as anti -inflammatory drugs.
It is recommended to rest and drink more water.Well, yes.Eat lightly.
Basically, I was sleeping most of the time, and I couldn't eat it.
Eat a little more disgusting.
Eat some porridge.Because the weather is hot, people's appetite is poor.
OK, thanks.
You're welcome.
