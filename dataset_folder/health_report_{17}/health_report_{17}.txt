Hello.Sometimes I have constipation, there is no blood on the stool, but there is blood on the paper.But if I am inconvenient, there is no blood. What is going on?(Male, 17 years old)
How long have you been in this case?
It's been a while.
I forgot the specific time.
It should be caused by hemorrhoids.
Is this anal fissure or hemorrhoids?
(⊙o⊙) Oh.
What should I do?Do you need surgery?
Anal fissure should be bleed more.
It is recommended to go to the hospital for a check and see if surgical treatment is needed.
You can also pay attention to a light diet.
Okay, I have worked hard, thank you very much.
You're welcome.
