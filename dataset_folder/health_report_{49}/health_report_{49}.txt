I can.
Yesterday was not so smelly, it was stinky today, and I dared not wear pajamas.
Suddenly like this.

No.
I didn't take a bath for two days.
In the past two days, use warm saline to wash and take a look at it. If this is still the best to go to the dermatology department, let the doctor see what kind of ointment needs to be used.
Then I have been insomnia and the back pain is not sleepy. Why is it? I went to the toilet several times yesterday night.
how old?Are there any frequent urination and urinary pain?
At the age of 13, I still wanted to urinate after urination, and I always felt that I didn't urinate.
Then go to test a urine routine, afraid of urinary tract infection.
