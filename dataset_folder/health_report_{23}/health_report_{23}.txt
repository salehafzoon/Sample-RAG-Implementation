Hello doctor, I have been diarrhea for a month. I was relatively frequent before, several times a day, and now once a day, I can hardly hurt, I have not spit it, and the bowel movements feel a lot of water.There are no obvious changes, what is going on?(Male, 21 years old)
Hello, how long do you start to use the medicine?Is there any inspection?
After more than a week of medication, I have not been specifically checked.
What kind of medicine?How many times a day?Are they all stretching water?
Only get up once in the morning.
This is the case now.
It feels like a lot of water, with some particulate matter, it may be food.
In response to this consultation, the doctor updated the summary suggestion: During the suggestion of diarrhea: It is recommended to use medication money or intestinal birth+memond -dehydrated scattered trial.Drink plenty of water. If there are many diarrhea, infusion treatment is recommended to prevent the dysfunction of hydrolytic acid and alkali.You can also check the routine of the feces and the training of the feces to see if there are inflammation.If there is inflammation, it is recommended to use the medicine for littering+Catalmanship (of course, the effect of anti -inflammatory anti -inflammatory drugs, but the adverse reactions are relatively large, allergic to this medicine, for pregnant women, disabled under 18 years of age.) Dr. Chunyu can not prescribe the prescription.for reference only!
Thanks.
I think it should be a improper diet before, and it should be caused by drinking cold drinks.
Don't thank you, I wish you health and pay attention to diet.You are polite.Thank you for your heart.
