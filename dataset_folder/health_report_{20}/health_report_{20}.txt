When eating barbecue, diarrhea is the same, and it is the same as eating hot pot. It is not the case. I donâ€™t know why it is like this (male, 17 years old)
Excuse me, this time it has always been such symptoms.
first.
Is there any abdominal distension?
It is the pain on the left side of the stomach, and it can't be said.
Considering the possibility of acute enteritis.
Please be a light diet for the past two days.
oh.
There is no big problem.
If diarrhea stops gradually, the problem should not be very big
