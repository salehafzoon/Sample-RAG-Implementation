It is recommended that you usually eat more foods rich in cellulose and eat some sashimi.
Digestion does not stool.
This is what happened.
It should be indigestion, constipation, drink plenty of water, and exercise appropriately.
Do you need to do a colonoscopy or something?
It has lasted for three or four years,
