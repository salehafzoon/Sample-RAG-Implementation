I started to attack repeatedly three times ago, and it is still more hiccups. What is the reason?(Male, 27 years old)
Hello, is it gone when you sleep?
Yes, it is.
Is there any nervous anxiety during this time?
No, just hanging water the night before hiccup.
Inhale deeply, you can't bear it until you can't bear it.It will improve.
What caused me?
It may be diaphragmic spasm.
Thank you for your method. I won't play now, it's not a problem with the body.
Look at it again, there should be no problem.
