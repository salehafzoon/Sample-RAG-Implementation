Because you eat too much, what kind of medicine should you take for stomach pain these days (male, 63 years old)
Hello, how long has this situation last?Is it aggravated?
After 6 days, I went to a small hospital to take blood to test without inflammation. It was a bit reduced every day. It was mainly ate a lot of food. I ate a lot of meat at night.
It still hurts to drink a glass of boiling water.
Okay, first of all, it is recommended that you do not eat too much meat at night, it is not easy to digest, and it is easy to bloate.
Dinner is generally recommended to eat around 6 o'clock.
Have you taken any medicine these days?How's the effect.
What kind of medicine should I buy now?
Have you never taken medicine these days?
I have eaten Japan's Jifazan, and I have eaten it several times. It is useless.
A week ago, my stomach was particularly good and there was no problem.
OKEat some omeprazole and dopanllthalone tablets.
The key is that you have a special bloating as soon as you drink water.
One is stomach pain, and the other is to promote gastrointestinal motility.
It is best to drink some warm porridge these days.Let the intestine relieve.
Thank you very much!OK
You are welcome, I hope you recover soon.
Thank you doctor.
What we should do, I wish you good health.
