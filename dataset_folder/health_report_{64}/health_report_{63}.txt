Hello doctor.I am now seven and a half months after giving birth, and I am still breastfeeding.Since June, I often feel bloating, fatigue, and mildly want to vomit but can't vomit.It will be relieved at night.Frequent constipation, occasionally there are diarrhea.Sometimes I feel that stomach acid has burning stomach.Sometimes at night, you can hear the gurgling sound in the intestine.At present, because the amount of meals during breastfeeding is quite large, but because you want to take a child to sleep, you usually lie down and exercise less after meals.I have diagnosed the esophagus reflux many years ago, and now occasionally.How to condition like me?During breastfeeding, I don't want to do painless gastroscopy, nor can I accept ordinary gastroscopy.(Female, 32 years old)
After 5 pm, as the gas is poured out, it will be much more comfortable.I ate a little less at noon in the past few days, and it will be better in the afternoon.
Hello, there should be gastrointestinal disorders.There may be gastritis.
How to judge severity?Do I need to do gastroscopy?
It is best to take a look if you have a long -term recurrence.
It has been two months so far.
Can I do painless gastroscopy during breastfeeding?Do I still need to do a colonoscopy?
Ordinary gastroscopy can be used during lactation.You can do gastroscopy first.
OKWhat should I pay attention to?
In addition, there is a capsule gastroscopy, which is not so painful and the cost is relatively high. Can you see it clearly?
Do not eat cold and hot and spicy foods, three meals, keep sufficient sleep.
It's not as clear as ordinary gastroscopy.
Do you feel serious?
Do you have to do gastroscopy?
You can eat the gastrointestinal tract of Daxi and Jiayeobacteria first.It does not affect breastfeeding.

Eat for about a month.
Okay, thank you doctor.
