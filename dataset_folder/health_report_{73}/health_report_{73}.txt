Recently, I feel that the gastrointestinal function is not good, often the stool does not take shape, takes intestinal inflammation, the Malaysian sour song pudding, and the intestines have improved. This morning, I have a porridge and scallion cake.What is the reason why rice, glory tofu and chicken soup, diarrhea, water sample before 2 hours?(Male, 46 years old)
Hello, this may have something to do with what you eat.Insufficient.
It should be clean.
Is it vomiting?
Do not vomit.
The lower abdomen has slight swelling and dry mouth.
Dry mouth is because of diarrhea.
It is recommended that you test a blood routine and stool, whether it is acute gastroenteritis.If so, it should be anti -inflammatory.
It took the stool this morning, but it was not thick yesterday morning, and the amount was not large.
I just stooled again, and it was also formed, but it was rotten.
Sorry, the operating room just came down, let you wait for a long time, sorry, it means that it is okay, it's okay.
After eating at noon for a while, I felt a stool, and the urine was frequent.
It is recommended to go to the hospital for testing.
