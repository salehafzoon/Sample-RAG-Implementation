Hello, how long has this situation?Is the diet regular?
Is there any food that stimulates food or cold.
It has been four or five days. I have a stool when I ate Amoshilin in the first rhinitis. After a few days of laxative spirit, it is like this now, and it is normal.
Haven't eaten food and cold.
How many times a day?Take a look at it.
It is normal once a day, sometimes at night, sometimes not.
Do you make a routine, and then confirm it?
Yes.
No blood in the stool.
Good doctor, if there is no change, you don't need to take medicine, right?
Yes, no need.
Ok, thank you!
