Hello!Doctor, I am 20 years old. I have had chronic gastritis a few years ago. In recent months, my diet habits are not very good. Sometimes I eat less and eat more.In the past few months, I can’t feel hunger and full, and my stomach does not hurt before, that is, uncomfortable, acid reflux, and the stomach is still cool. I ca n’t feel it when I eat it.If you want to hiccups, you ca n’t beat it, but you can rush up when you just eat it. If you ca n’t spit out, you will only spit out the residue of the food, and then you feel that there are foreign objects in the throat.It's strange, cool, and the part of the stomach still feels burning, causing me not to feel mood all day and irritable.Skilled appetite, if you want to eat, you are uncomfortable to eat.There is a desire to stool, but sometimes it can't get out.Want to ask if it is a symptom of reflux gastritis?IntersectionIs it strict?Do you want to go to the hospital for gastroscopy?IntersectionTrouble the doctor!(Female, 18 years old)
