In the past two days, I often feel uncomfortable in my stomach. What do I feel like I want to vomit?(Female, 23 years old)
Is there any inappropriate food recently? When is it uncomfortable? Eat the empty stomach still eats things, is menstruation normal, how about urination, and what else are other uncomfortable?
Have you been nervous and stressful recently.
This feeling has only appeared in the past two days. The uncomfortable symptoms of time during the time period are full of feelings in the stomach and want to vomit.
Normal menstruation just ended for six or seven days.
These two days are more anorexia.
I don't want to eat as soon as I eat.
These two days are more anorexia.
It is indigestion. Try it with drugs such as digestive enzymes or consumption tablets for a few days. If the symptoms continue to improve after medication, it is recommended to return to the consultation.
Okay, thank you doctor.
