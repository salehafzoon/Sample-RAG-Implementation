Hello doctor, this is my problem: what is the reason for suddenly vomiting blood (female, 57 years old)
Hello!Is there any other symptoms to be supplemented.
Is it click or spit it out?
In the past two days, I woke up with blood and blood clots in my mouth at night.
Is it gum bleeding?
Just once a night.
It has been two consecutive days.
Are there any other diseases?
hypertension.
Are there any stomach problems?
Recently, teeth are a bit swollen.
rhinitis?
no.
No.
It should be the problem of teeth.
Lumbar disc herniation.
It is recommended to check in the dental department.
It has nothing to do with the lumbar spine.It should still be a gum problem.
Tooth problem?Is there a lot of bleeding?very scary.
It is also possible.
Both legs were soft and panting.
Specifically, you still need to check it carefully.What color is the stool?
Please talk about the specific examination.
She said every few days.
Just look at the blood routine, and check the oral cavity.
I didn't ask, sorry.
how about afternoon.
What is the color of the stool?
Eat meals.
It's right.
All right.
thank you.
Don't thank you.
By the way, ask, walking, softness and lumbar disc herniation have something to do.
It doesn't matter, it should be the problem of cardiopulmonary function.
Thanks.
Don't be polite.
Also, why does the problem of the teeth be sleeping at night?
At present, it is just doubt, and it cannot be said that it is caused by the teeth. The main information you give is not detailed enough.
And walking is panting, or it may be inadequate heart function.Or lung problem.
